# Privacy Policy for FormGuard (form-safe)

Last updated: 2026-02-23

This extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data or usage data.

- No data is collected from the browser or the websites you visit.
- No data is sent to any server or third-party service.
- The extension runs entirely in the user's browser as a content script and only registers an event handler to prompt the user when leaving a page with unsaved form inputs.
- There is no analytics, telemetry, crash reporting, or remote configuration.

If you host a copy of this repository (for example on GitHub) the raw PRIVACY.md file may be served from that host; otherwise this file is the canonical privacy policy. If you publish the extension to the Chrome Web Store, provide the hosted URL to this file (for example: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/><your-github-username>/form-safe/main/PRIVACY.md).
